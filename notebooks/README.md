# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for the Intelligent Complaint Analysis Platform.

## Notebooks

### Task 1: EDA and Preprocessing
- **`task-1-eda-preprocessing.ipynb`**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing pipeline for CFPB complaint dataset.

## Usage

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Navigate to the desired notebook and run cells sequentially.

## Notebook Guidelines

- Each notebook should be self-contained and reproducible
- Include clear markdown cells explaining the purpose and methodology
- Document assumptions and decisions
- Save outputs to appropriate directories (`data/processed/`, etc.)
- Keep notebooks focused on a single task or analysis

## Future Notebooks

- `task-2-embedding-generation.ipynb`: Embedding generation and vector database setup
- `task-3-rag-pipeline.ipynb`: RAG pipeline implementation and testing
- Additional analysis notebooks as needed
